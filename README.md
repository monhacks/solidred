# Pokémon Solid Red and Solid Blue

This is a hack for Pokemon Red and Blue which aims only to fix the myrid bugs in Generation 1 Pokemon, and nothing else. To see what bugs are fixed in this project, [please refer to the wiki](https://github.com/tustin2121/solidred/wiki).

This is a fork of the [disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue](https://github.com/pret/pokered).
